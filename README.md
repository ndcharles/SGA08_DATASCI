# This is my ReadMe file for the Stutern Data Skills.

If you're looking at this right now, know that you have been to _my_Life_in_Tech_ space again.

I am a ~~learner my friend,~~ no shame in that.

One more thing, I am working to write about this _my_Life_in_Tech_ journey on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nndcharles) and on [Opendiari](https://www.opendiari.com/my_life_in_tech)

I also have a central resume-like page on [Carrd](https://ndcharles.carrd.co)
